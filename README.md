Some code i used to generate all sets of 3 Pokemon that resist all types

NOTE: This requires both a "pokedex.js" and a "type_data.js" to be copied from Honko's damage calc and placed in the same directory as index.html. Then index can be run in a browser. 
The files you need can be copied from here: https://github.com/Zarel/honko-damagecalc/tree/master/js/data
